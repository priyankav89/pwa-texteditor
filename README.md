so that the user can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## USAGE

WHEN the user run `npm run start:dev` from the root directory,Then the user find that the application should start up the backend and serve the client

When the user run my webpack plugins,Then the user find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

When the user use next-gen JavaScript in my application,Then the user find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

When the user open the text editor,Then the user find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

When the user enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window,Then the user find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

When the user reopen the text editor after closing it,Then the user find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

When the user click on the Install button,Then the user can download my web application as an icon on my desktop

When the user load my web application, Then the user should have a registered service worker using workbox

When the user register a service worker,Then the user should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

When the user deploy to Heroku, Then the user should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
